Our main objective is to develop an intelligent system which will use computer vision approaches for the classification of skin disease using Deep Learning Approach. 
By the use of computer technology, we want to make it simpler to detect the diseases
just from the images of the infected skin and could assist the human's ability to analyze complex information. 
Artificial Intelligence is taking up automation in all fields of application even in the healthcare field. 
Accordingly, our objective is to employ our idea to make computer to efficiently and effortlessly interpret a lot of images and result with the higher accuracy using various technology 
like: Gabor filter, CNN - deep learning algorithm.
